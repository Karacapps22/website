My name is Kara Capps and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at Texas A&M University with an interest in AI and Software Development. Before I started college, I had never taken any Computer Science classes. The subject seemed foreign and intimidating, so I never thought that I could study something like Computer Science. It wasn't until my sister, who was majoring in Computer Engineering, told me that she thought I would be good at it based on how I thought through mathematical problems while she tutored me in my senior year of high school that I thought about the possibility of pursuing a technological field. I followed a C++ programming tutorial and after creating my first basic program, I decided that Computer Science was what I wanted to do. Ever since then, I have always been grateful to my sister for introducing me to the subject I have become so passionate about. Two things that solidified my decision was my social organization, <a class href="https://www.awics.org">AWICS</a></dd> (Aggie Women in Computer Science), and the opportunity I had to attend the <a class href="https://ghc.anitab.org">Grace Hopper Conference</a></dd> towards the beginning of my college career. I had an amazing experience connecting with other women in Computer Science and I'm excited to be able to attend Grace Hopper again virtually this year. In addition to my studies, I worked at Starbucks this past year and am an amateur latte artist. I enjoyed working at Starbucks because it was a fast paced environment, I loved seeing how happy customers were when they got their favorite drink, and I got to connect with so many different kinds of people. During my free time I enjoy traveling with my sister and friends, working out, and cooking. I have been a vegetarian for three years and went vegan at the beginning of 2020, so I have enjoyed experimenting with new vegan recipes. I also own a cat who keeps me company during quarantine!<br>
